- âš¡ Fun fact: I was introduced to programming by using an Arduino when I was 19. I loved working with it, but didn't know how to fix error messages so I gave up on it. Then, I became an EMT for 3 years. I realized that its not for me. I'm making a career change, and am hoping to get my first junior software developer job in 2021.
