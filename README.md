### Hi there 👋

- ⚡ Fun fact: I was introduced to programming by using an Arduino when I was 19. I loved working with it, but didn't know about how to fix error messages so I gave up on it. I  then became an EMT for 3 years. I'm making a career change, and am hoping to get my first software developer job in 2021.
